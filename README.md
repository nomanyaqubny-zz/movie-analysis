This project analyzes the actual box office success of the movie (available online from www.the-numbers.com/daily-box-office-chart) and how it correlates with the volume of tweets in Twitter. By breaking down the tweets geographically it is possible to understand the relative local tweet volume trend per US state and identify those states that require special marketing attention to support box office success of the movie.


The entire analysis and creation of this report has been done in IBM Bluemix. The following Bluemix elements have been used:

1. IBM Insights for Twitter
2. IBM dashDB
3. RStudio (via dashDB service)
4. Node.JS runtime

The working prototype can be found here https://movieanalysis.mybluemix.net/
